Struggling to do big data literature review? Check out this free Python code that can help you extract research paper data to facilitate easy data extraction.

Steps:
1. Go to https://scopus.com/ and find particular research topics using the Advanced Search tool.
2. Download the data into a BibTeX (.bib) file
3. Convert the data into a text file (.txt) by copy-pasting.
4. See if the data has authors or not (sometimes authors' data may not be exported)
5. Use the appropriate code from the repository

Files:
main code_with abstract: if the .txt file has all the necessary data and you wish to extract abstract too.
main code_without abstract: if the .txt file has all the necessary data and you wish not to extract abstract too.
no author_with abstract: if the .txt file does not have authors' data and you wish to extract the abstract too.
no author_without abstract: if the .txt file does not have authors' data and you wish not to extract the abstract too.

Choose the code according to your data and preferences.

Best Wishes!
